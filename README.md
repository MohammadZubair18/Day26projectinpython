Hello friends, today we will make an age calculator using python’s GUI library tkinter so, let’s start.

Python offers a very good GUI library i.e. tkinter which is very easy to learn and use.

Here, we are creating a GUI application to calculate age using a button.


We will ask the user to enter the name and date of birth.

Then we will get that information from the entry widgets and will calculate the user’s age.

At last, we will show the user’s age with the name.

We will use "calculateAge()" function to calculate the age of the user.

So, let’s understand the code now.
